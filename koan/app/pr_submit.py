        pr_title: Full PR title string (caller builds it).

        issue_url: Optional issue URL for the cross-link comment.
        base_branch: Optional target branch for the PR (e.g. "11.126").

            reason when PR submission fails (push error, gh error, no commits,
            HEAD landed on the base branch). Lets callers surface the failure
            to Telegram instead of leaving it in logs only.
        skill_name: Optional origin skill (e.g. ``"fix"``, ``"implement"``)
            included in Jira status comments.
